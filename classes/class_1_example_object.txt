Instance: Alex's wine

Attributes:
type 'pinot grigio'
container 'class bottle'
unopened = true
size 25oz

Methods:

change_type: becomes 'merlot'
open_container: unopened = false
close_container: unopened = true
pour_wine: size becomes 20oz

Alex's Note:
If the order is important to the methodology it should go:

change_type: close_container might throw up an error code because the bottle is sitting at unopened = true
open_container: unopened = false
pour_wine: size becomes 20oz
